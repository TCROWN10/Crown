# ✅ Crown Frontend-Smart Contract Integration Complete!

## 🎉 **Integration Summary**

Your Crown platform's frontend is now fully integrated with your deployed Hedera smart contracts!

### ✅ **What Was Done**

1. **Extracted ABIs from Hardhat Artifacts**:
   - ✅ `TicketNft.json` - NFT ticket contract ABI
   - ✅ `EventTicketing.json` - Event creation and management ABI  
   - ✅ `TicketResaleMarket.json` - Resale marketplace ABI

2. **Updated Contract Addresses**:
   - ✅ TicketNft: `0x03Dd1195E494A16Dd9fc6C6a66966e37F6b93031`
   - ✅ EventTicketing: `0xe3B26f999bffe5c356C659487E5D44fe14d912EB`
   - ✅ TicketResaleMarket: `0xc0ABf66a1D3eaf655827e054970150252a561B94`

3. **Frontend Updates**:
   - ✅ Updated all ABI imports to use Hardhat artifacts
   - ✅ Fixed contract addresses to Hedera testnet
   - ✅ Connected all components to deployed contracts

### 📁 **Files Location**

**ABIs** (Extracted from Hardhat):
```
frontend/src/lib/abis/
├── TicketNft.json
├── EventTicketing.json
└── TicketResaleMarket.json
```

**Contract Configuration**:
```
frontend/src/lib/abiAndAddress.ts
frontend/src/lib/contracts.ts
```

### 🚀 **How to Use**

Your frontend now uses the ABIs directly from Hardhat, which means:
- ✅ **Always in sync** with your smart contracts
- ✅ **Type-safe** contract interactions
- ✅ **Up-to-date** ABI whenever you compile

### 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the Integration**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Connect Your Wallet**:
   - Connect to Hedera testnet
   - Make sure you have HBAR for transactions

3. **Try Purchasing a Ticket**:
   - The transaction should now work properly
   - Check HashScan for transaction details

### 🔧 **If You Make Changes to Smart Contracts**

After modifying and redeploying your contracts:

1. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   cd smcontract
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Extract ABIs** (automatically done):
   ```bash
   node -e "..."
   ```

3. **Redeploy** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:hedera:testnet
   ```

4. **Update addresses** in `abiAndAddress.ts` if contracts were redeployed

### ✅ **Integration Complete!**
